How does it respond to:
    I want to build a robot.
    -> It says "What would it mean to build a robot?"

    I want to understand French.
    -> It says "What would it mean to understand French?"

    Do you like me?
    -> It says "What makes you think that I like you?"

    You confuse me.
    -> It says "What makes you think that I confuse you?"

Find an example of when the "Why do you /something/ me?" structure does not work well. How can you improve it?
    This structure does not work in the case of "I will do that for you." It responds with "Why do you will do that for me?" which does not make sense. It would be challenging to improve this. I would have to test further for grammar, and then implement a different solution depending on the grammar. For this example, it would return "Why will you do that for me?"
